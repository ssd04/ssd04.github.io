# Notes

We might compare in a wrong way humans and robots.

Main different:
- inability of electronic machines to replicate themselves, compared to biological systems

We get inspired from nature, from biological being, and construct electronic devices and
machines, but the principles that they work with are often quite different:
- we got inspired by birds when it comes to airplanes, but an airplane does not fly like a
bird

The same issues addressed in this article [^bitter-lesson] when it comes to AI systems and
the human intent to create human like minds into AI. It seems like brute force searching and
learning is more effective than trying to imply a lot of twiks and tricks from human like
behaviour
    - besides that, we don't really know how we think, how we memorize, out minds are very
    complex, we often simplify and reduce our mind processes too easily

The fact the we've got inspired by neural network in the brain, and it's a useful model,
it does not mean we've got it about the brain, and trying to infer other brain-like processes
into artificial neural networks does not mean that it would help.
    - it can be the same with genetic algorithms

We might not need to try so much to make robots with human-like processes.

Besides all of this, we do not really understand conciousness, we might need to be more humble
and do not get so much into the materialistic view of the world.

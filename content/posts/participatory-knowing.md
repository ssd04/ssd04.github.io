# Notes

- different classifications/types of knowledge
    - from philosofical textbook
    - from John Vervaeke

- it has to do more with thinks like: behaviour, actions, general patterns of life

- there is something to participatory knowing
    - we tend to trick ourselves into thinking that we acquire something by getting information
    - when most of the time there is need for some participation, engagement into the topic/idea
    we need to grasp it more
        - we can even talk about multiple level of understanding over a particular comprehensive
        topic (like talent vs work - we might need quite a lot of experience to truly get it)

- is basic structure embedded in us OR we learn everything entirely ?
    - because this will influence our perception of acquiring knowledge
    - are we totally framed by education and learning?

- examples:
    - design patterns in programming:
        - you might think that you get the patterns from toy examples, but it needs more to
        really use them properly, also because it has to do with drawling the line, finding
        the balance (*article on balance), when and where to add abstractions
    - grow up /good posture: probably most parents tell their kids to stay straight, but usually it's
    more than that, most of the time is psychological, it requires discipline, maybe changing
    some perceptions, some pre-conceptions, it means growing up; that doesn't happen just by
    telling someone to grow up, it's a participatory knowing
    - inductive learning: we usually learn through examples and in time we end up understanding
    the higher, more abstract, principle (example: learning math - you might get used to 
    exercises and numbers but really getting the meaning and intetions behind all those simbols
    might take you quite a lot of time)

- probably something important to note: understanding that kids learn best by participation
might be a very important thing to keep in mind, if we get trained in some patterns growing
up it might determine out life tremendously
- but still, there is the question around how much we can change our knowledge, how much we
can "re-train" our mind

- over all of this, we have to be aware of the problem of reductionism, witch I think we
face it all the time, especially nowadays (article on reductionism)

More or less, everyone has to work and improve communication skills.

***To speak better we need to write***.

A very good way to level up our speech is to write. Because writing involves
thinking, it makes us articulate better our thoughts and ideas. It has something
to do with **structural** thinking. In order to be able to write upon a certain
topic, we have to define a clear structure for the topic in our heads, we have to
develop our network of knowledge.

***To understand each other better we need to write***.

We have to communicate all the time in different forms.
The better we are at putting in words what we think and
how we think, the better we understand each other. 
One way to practice this is by reading and writing things down.

***In order to grow up intellectually we need to write***.

To develop ourselves intellectually we need to acquire knowledge and wisdom. We can do that
by reading what others have thought until know. When reading different ways of
thinking, from different periods of time, we confront our tree of ideas.
We put our minds to work.
We start to shape our thoughts and perceptions. To put things in order into
our minds it's good to put them on a piece of paper and try to make sense of it all.
We come back to writing again.

But why write publicly? Whenever we do things only for ourselves, without others to check
and evaluate, we tend to be more permissive and superficial. When we expose to others, we
might be more careful with our words and we might learn more in the process. 

It can also be a way to get over some self imposed limits and thresholds, a way to get out
of the comfort zone, open up to critics and expose bad personal preconceptions and insecurities.
Maybe even a way to ***grow up mentally and psychologically***.

Why writing since there is already a lot out there written and most of the ideas has been
already laid out? Firstly, it is a good learning exercise, and secondly, it might resonate
with other people who might think in the same patterns.

It is also a good way to improve *english* as a second language.

By *challenging* ourselves to write we see the need for better skills, we realize that
*we don't really know how to write well*. By realizing this we end up reading more on
the topic, we try to apply it, we ***practice***, and get into the learning cycle,
improving step by step.

Probably the best ways to improve communication and thinking is to learn how to write.
Like every other process of learning we have to **learn by doing**. 

So that's ***Why to Write***.
